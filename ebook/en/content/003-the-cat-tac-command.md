# The `cat` command
---

The `cat` command allows us to create single or multiple files, view content of a file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files.

The "cat" stands for 'concatenate.' and it is one of the most frequently used commands in the Linux terminal.


### Examples of uses:


1. To display content of a file in terminal:

```
cat <specified_file_name>
```

2. To display content of multiple files in terminal:

```
cat file1 file2 ...
```

3. To create a file with cat command:

```
cat > filename
```

5. To display all the files in current directory:

```
cat *
```

6. To redirect a file to the other file:

```
cat oldfile > newfile
```
7. Use cat command with `more` and `less` options:

```
cat filename | more
cat filename | less
```

8. Append the contents of file1.txt to file2.txt

```
cat file1.txt >> file2.txt
```

9. Some implementations of cat, with option -n, can also number lines

```
cat -n file1.txt file2.txt > newnumberedfile.txt
```


### Syntax:

```
cat [OPTION] [FILE]...
```

# The `tac` command

`tac` is a Linux command that allows viewing files line-by-line, beginning from the last line. (tac doesn't reverse the contents of each individual line, only the order in which the lines are presented.) It is named by analogy with `cat`.


### Examples of uses:


1. To display content of a file in terminal:

```
tac <specified_file_name>
```

2. This option attach the separator before instead of after.

```
tac -b concat.txt tacexample.txt
```
3. This option will interpret the separator as a regular expression.
```
tac -r concat.txt tacexample.txt
```
4. This option use STRING as the separator instead of newline.
```
tac -s concat.txt tacexample.txt
```

5. This option will display the help text and exit.

```
tac --help
```
6. This option will give the version information and exit.

```
tac --version
```

### Syntax:

```
tac [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

### Additional Flags and their Functionalities:

|**Short Flag**   |**Long Flag**   |**Description**   |
|:---|:---|:---|
|`-b`|`--before`|attach the separator before instead of after|
|`-r`| `--regex`|interpret the separator as a regular expression|
|`-s`| `--separator=STRING`|use STRING as the separator instead of newline|
|<center>-</center>|`--help`|display this help and exit|
|<center>-</center>|`--version`|output version information and exit|
